# Dataquest Guided Projects

This repo contains several projects I undertook while studying Data Science (following Dataquest courses).

- Profitable app profile : The aim of this project is to analyse and gain key information about mobile application on the two main markets (GooglePlay and Apple Store) in order to help the marketing strategy.

- Bike Rental Prediction : in this project, we will explore and predict bike rental services needs based on date, time and weather condition. To do so, we'll use different regression models, error metrics and hyperparameter tuning.

- Car Price Prediction : after exploring and cleaning the dataset, we'll predict a car price based on its mecanical caracteristic. Here you will see data cleaning (removing or replacing missing values), univariate and multivariate K Neighboor regression.

- Kaggle Titanic Problem : This project is a skeleton of a submission workflow for the notorious Titanic problem from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes data cleaning and processing, feature engineering and selection, grid search on different regression models and submission saving process. 

- Handwritten digit recognition : quite self-explanatory, here we'll take a look at different classifying algorithm (KNN, MLP, decision tree and Random Forest).

- House Sale Price Estimation : Here we'll use the AmesHousing dataset to predict the price of a house. Building a better model at incrementally while creating a well structured method in the process. It all comes down to three main steps : transform the features, select them and testing the model. This a is a great start for any prediction problem.
