# Dataquest Guided Projects

This repo contains several projects I undertook while studying Data Science (following Dataquest courses).

- Profitable app profile : The aim of this project is to analyse and gain key information about mobile application on the two main markets (GooglePlay and Apple Store) in order to help the marketing strategy.

- Bike rental Prediction : in this project, we will explore and predict bike rental services needs based on date, time and weather condition. To do so, we'll use different regression models, error metrics and hyperparameter tuning.
